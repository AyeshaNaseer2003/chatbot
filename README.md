💼 My Internship Tasks:

✅ Implement a React Agent using LangChain (ReAct framework)

✅ Use Gemini as the LLM

✅ Store the system prompt on Langfuse for logging and traceability

✅ Save chat history in MongoDB using AgenticMongoDBSaver

✅ Add tools:

📂 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using Netsol’s financial reports stored in MongoDB

🌐 Tavily for web search-based queries

✅ Build a backend with FastAPI using:

Proper routers

Chat interaction via registration ID

✅ Create a simple Streamlit frontend to interact with the chatbot

This project is helping me learn how real-world LLM agents work with tools and memory, and how to combine AI with backend and frontend systems.
